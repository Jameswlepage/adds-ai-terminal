    - /help - show available commands
    - /new - start fresh conversation (clears history)
    - /clear - clear screen only (keeps history)
    - /preset [name] - switch prompt preset (coding, research, ops)
    - /ctx - toggle knowledge base context on/off
    - /tutorial - show this guide
    - /search [query] - web search with citations
